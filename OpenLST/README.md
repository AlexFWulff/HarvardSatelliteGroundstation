# OpenLST Radio

OpenLST is an open source, proven radio design for communicating with remote
instruments, vehicles, and stations using low-cost commercial components.

## History

Planet developed the Low-Speed Transceiver (LST) for UHF telemetry, command,
and control for the Dove satellite.

Over 100 on-orbit Dove satellites use the LST today.

OpenLST draws on Planet’s experience and success with the LST hardware and
firmware.

## Reliability

Planet has used its LST UHF radio on over 200 Dove satellites. Based on
commercial hardware, the LST has several hundred cumulative years of on-orbit
operation.

The LST has an outstanding success record (with over 200 cumulative years of
on-orbit operations) despite having a component cost of < $50.

## Applications

OpenLST is an open source, proven radio design for communicating with remote
instruments, vehicles, and stations using low-cost commercial components.
